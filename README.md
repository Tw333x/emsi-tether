Android USB Tethering Project. Open Source project of Emsi Tether Android App https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emsilabs.emsitether

### Desriptions
This project are now opened to everyone. Emsi Tether is an Android App that can notify user when USB Cable connected to gadget, then easily to access the USB Tethering Mode.

## Why?
Android has some restriction function to access the Tether Mode, so this project only using com.android.settings.TetherSettings component and integrated with Intent to access Setting Activity.
I think it's very helpfull (for me) when using USB Cable to choose the Tethering Connection.
